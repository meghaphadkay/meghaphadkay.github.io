Hi, I’m Megha.

I am a 22 year old Law student working in the space of Climate policy and Environmental Management. 

I always wanted a space where I could write about my work, without stressing about the word-limit. A space which truly reflects my potential, dreams, and personality. So here it is! In my opinion, a 2-page resume doesn’t do justice to the work done by you . You can’t truly know the projects by reading 2 lines about them. 

Here is a small glimpse of my life, where you can see the projects I am most proud of, some of my biggest achievements, my favorite experiences, the articles I have written, and my formal qualifications too. 

Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions related to this domain or any project in particular. I’m always down for conversations on Climate. 

Thank you for stopping by.
Happy surfing :)
