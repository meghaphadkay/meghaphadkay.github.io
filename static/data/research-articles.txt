The pandemic has made the economies even more vulnerable to Climate Change than they were
before. Against this backdrop, along with mitigation measures, prioritizing adaptation options is
needed. The best instrument to facilitate and implement Adaptation strategies is - National Adaptation
Plans (NAP). This paper gives a detailed procedure of formulating, implementing, and reviewing National
Adaptation Plans. It analyses the current legislation and institutions India has for Climate Change
adaptation, and gives suggestions on how to make it more effective. It also suggests a Legislative
plan to make the entire process of NAPs more standardized and easy to follow.

- heading: Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR): A TWAIL perspective 
- link:
I was the youngest paper presenter at S.P. Sathe International Conference on Climate Change this year, where I presented this paper, alongside dignitaries like Vandana Shiva, Prof. Alexandra Harrington and Ms Sunita Narain.

The article discusses the concept of "Common but Differentiated Responsibilities" (CBDR) in the context of international environmental law, particularly focusing on the perspective of Third World countries as advocated by the Third World Approach to International Law (TWAIL). The CBDR principle recognizes that climate responsibilities should vary based on a nation's development and circumstances. The principle's dynamic nature, ambiguity, and contested interpretations have led to amny necessary debates. The article suggests that CBDR should consider social, political, technological, and scientific aspects, aiming for global yet differentiated climate action. The TWAIL perspective highlights historical injustices, colonialism's impact, and the need for equitable solutions. Implementing CBDR through Nationally Determined Contributions is emphasized, urging a comprehensive and just approach for effective climate action.
