I am a Researcher, Student, Speaker, Artist and  a Climate Advocate. 


Involved in the Field of Conservation since the age of 12, I am an Environmental Law student working in the field of ‘Climate Change Policy 'and ‘Climate Resilience of Vulnerable Communities’.

I work on Climate, Law, and Policy, primarily in the Urban space.I have been trained in performing Climate Vulnerability Assessment & Resilience Building for Urban and Semi-urban Communities. I have formal education in Public Affairs, International Relations and Environmental Law.

I have spent a majority of my childhood volunteering for conservation projects, participating in wildlife census, and working with indigenous tribes for climate justice.  For that, I have collected, analyzed data, and compiled the findings in reports and research articles.
 
I have been selected by UNICEF as a Youth representative, by EECC as a Youth leader, and by US Department of State as a Climate Action Champion.

I’m currently working as a Climate Policy Researcher at EECC (Energy, Environment and Climate Change), where I include the demands of communities in policy recommendations which are pitched to the Local and State government bodies. I am working on proposing policies to increase the carbon sequestration potential of the Pune Metropolitan Region, with a dream of making it Net Carbon neutral by 2050!

Along with Climate Policy analysis and research, I love giving talks and conducting seminars on Climate Action and Policy. I have been invited to give climate-talks and seminars to Youth about their participation in policy making, and there is nothing more I like to do than convincing young adults of my generation that their voice matters in the world, and they can truly bring about a change!

I like to engage with communities about the impact of their actions on Climate Change. I feel that each one of us should utilize our voice and our privilege, to have conversations about the topics which need our attention . It’s high time we come out of our bubble and acknowledge what is truly happening in the world.

In my free time you’ll catch me brewing coffee, sketching, or fostering the strays :)
