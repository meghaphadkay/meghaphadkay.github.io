# Documentation
Hi Megha, this set of pages is your instruction manual.

Each page on the website is created using 3 parts -
1. The data files in `static/data/` which store the content of a page
2. The `.html` files which control how a page looks
3. The JavaScript files in `static/js/` which take the content you write and put them in the HTML files

Each page has its own data file, HTML file, and JavaScript file. They come together to create the page. Usually I will be editing the HTML and JavaScript files, and you will be editing the data files and adding/removing stuff from the `static/media/` folder. To make sure you are working with the latest version of all the files, **always remember to pull _before_ starting your work.** If you forget to pull, you won't be able to push your changes. If you pull _after_ you make your changes, there is a very small chance that you could get a merge conflict. In that case let me know.

## General Data File Format
All the data files follow a structured format with key-value pairs. Each key represents some property about an "object", and its corresponding value is written in front of it. 

For example, while describing a certification you have completed, the object is the certification itself. In this case, a key may be `"name"`, and its value may be `"Global Youth Climate Training"`. This is written in your data file as -

```yaml
- name: Global Youth Climate Training
```

A collection of these key-value pairs is used to describe an _object_. An object can be anything - from data about a certification to data about an op-ed, or publication, etc. For example, if you want to describe your degree at ILS as an object, you would write it as -

```yaml
- university: ILS Law College, Pune, India
- logo: static/media/Certification/ils.png
- degree: B.A, L.L.B
- date: May 2019 - May 2024
- modules: Environmental Law, International Economic Law, Economics (Macroeconomics and Microeconomics)
```

As you can see, this "object" contains all the data the JavaScript and HTML files need to create your Academics page. 

You can't put arbitrary keys in the object. Only the keys that the JavaScript code for that page supports will be used to create the page, and the other keys will be ignored. If you want to add new keys to an object let me know. 

For e.g, if you add a `"description"` key to this object, it will be ignored and your description will not be shown on the page, because the JavaScript for the academics page does not support the description key.

Between two objects in the same file, remember to add a `"--"`, surrounded by blank lines. For e.g,

```yaml
- name: Global Youth Climate Training
- awarded-by: University of Oxford
- link:
- logo: static/media/Certification/Oxford.png

--

- name: Constitution of India and Environmental Governance (All India Rank 1)
- awarded-by: Government of India, IISc (Indian Institute of Science)
- link:
- logo: static/media/Certification/IISc.jpeg
```

This helps the JavaScript identify where one object ends and another begins.

If the value of some key is large and has multiple lines, you can start the value on a new line instead of continuing it on the same line. For example, in the data file for the projects page, `projects.txt`, the `"description"` key is supported, which contains the description for a project. Since this description can have multiple lines, you can start it on a new line -

```yaml
- heading: Waterholes in Nagzira 
- photo: static/media/project-1-photo.jpg
- description:
Sentence 1.

Sentence 2.

Sentence 3.
```

This way, the description will also be shown on multiple lines on the page instead of in a single paragraph.

The next section lists the expected data format for each page, as well as the keys supported by each page.

## Pages
### Homepage
The homepage has two data files - `homepage-bio.txt` and `homepage-panels.txt`. 

The `homepage-bio.txt` file just has normal text that is shown on the front page. It does not need key value pairs, the text in that file is shown on the front page as it is.

The `homepage-panels.txt` file contains data for the `Featured` section of your homepage. You can add any number of objects in that file, and they will show up as a thumbnail on your homepage.

It supports the following keys -

1. `- image: ` - The image shown on the thumbnail. 
2. `- link: ` - The link to open when the user clicks on this thumbnail. The value for this key is optional. You can leave it blank if you don't have a link.
3. `- title: ` - The text to display under the image.

Example - 
```yaml
- image: static/media/toi.jpeg
- link: https://epaper.timesgroup.com/article-share?article=05_06_2023_004_010_toipuc_TOI
- title: Harnessing Youth Potential to Steer Conversations on Climate Crisis
```

### About Page
The about page has two data files - `about-bio.txt` and `favorites.txt`. Both of them are simple text files and require no special format like the other data files. The text in both files will be shown on the page as it is, with the only exception being that the first line of `about-bio.txt` will be shown in a large font.

To change the photo shown on the about page, replace the `static/media/about.jpg` file with your new photo.

4. `- description: ` - A description of the publication. If the description is longer than 200 characters, it will be cropped automatically

The `link` and `description` keys are not strictly required, but highly recommended.
